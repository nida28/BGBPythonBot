# BGB Bot
BGB Legal ChatBot is a friendly legal assistant focused on the German Civil Code (BGB). Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), it provides clear, practical answers to questions about tenant rights, contracts, consumer protections, and moreâ€”tailored especially for expats in Germany. The bot references official BGB sections with clickable links for easy access to the original legal texts. Hosted at https://huggingface.co/spaces/nfm1708/BGBChatBot.

## Setup Instructions

This repository **does not include** the `.env` file or the embeddings JSONL file to protect sensitive API keys and proprietary data.

### What you need to add manually:

1. **Create a `.env` file** in the project root with your OpenAI API key:

    ```bash
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
    ```

2. **Add the embeddings file** to the root folder as:

    ```bash
    bgb_embeddings_new_data.jsonl
    ```

This file contains the precomputed embeddings used by the application and is required for the chatbot to function.

---

### Notes:

- Make sure your `.env` file is included in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits.
- The embeddings file is large and proprietary, so please request access separately or generate your own using the embedding script here: https://github.com/nida28/BGBRagBot/blob/development/RAGBaseApp/RAGBaseApp/Program.cs 
- Without these files, the chatbot will not start or will fail to respond correctly.
